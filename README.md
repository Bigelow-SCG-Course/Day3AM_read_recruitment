## Repo for metagenomic read recruitment lesson for BSCG course 

Metagenomic read recruitment or mapping is one of the most commonly used process in genome analysis. It can be used for various purposes but in single cell genomics , it is applied to access the relative abundance of SAGs in metagenomic datasets (when metagenomes are used) or to estimate the expression level of the genes within individual SAGs (when metatranscriptomes are used).
